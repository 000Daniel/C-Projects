## Introduction
Get It is a simple to-do list program written entirely in the C program language.
It has the neat feature of working like a pop-up, where it is displayed above other programs.
This helps the users keep track of their tasks while working with a different program.

This project was an exercise to learn more about the Win32 API.
Unlike my previous [WinAPI exercise project](https://github.com/000Daniel/C-Projects/tree/main/WinAPI_exercise), this software is complete and ready for everyday use!

This software was programmed in Visual Studio Community 2022 (gcc 14.2.0).
>Note: This software is complete and will not receive further updates.
